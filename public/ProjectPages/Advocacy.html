                Queer representation is in a volatile and contested state in the current political climate, with symbols of pride such as painted crosswalks or flags being targeted nationally. 
                This is happening as LGBTQ+ characters and storylines are becoming more visible, sparking debates over their impact. 
                These social changes and debates directly affect youth, specifically those who are still forming their identities, and are forced to endure many social pressures and stigmas. 
                Protecting queer representation in both digital and physical forms is important to prevent mental health issues in youth who may not understand their identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                I categorize representations into two categories, symbolic and media-based, both having different key roles in how they support LGBTQ+ youth and increase social acceptance for queer identities. 
                Symbolic representation includes recognizable objects or ideas that represent a group, most significantly pride flags. 
                Silva Neves recognizes the importance of flags in his blog, he states “The pride flag is important for the marginalized queer communities because it can represent a place of belonging” (Neves). 
                Flags offer a way for queer youth to be seen and have a sense of belonging within a community by knowing they are in a safe space. 
                This is especially important for kids who could still be searching for a place to belong, giving them a sense of hope and preventing loneliness or helplessness. 
                Symbolic representation is not just limited to flags; it includes things like painted crosswalks or doors, rainbow stickers in a window, changing branding during pride month, and more. 
                Symbolic representation offers a wordless but loud way to show support for queer identities, especially youth who may be struggling to fit in. 
                Equally important, media-based representation includes any inclusion of a queer identity within publicized media such as TV shows, Movies, books, and more. 
                In a 2015 study, Bradley Bond and Benjamin Compton found a significant correlation between gay TV exposure and endorsement of gay equality (Bond). 
                Gay and queer identities being represented in media and create a shift in social expectations and break down stigmas over time. 
                This makes sense as including different identities in popular media will help normalize them in society and help people to rethink their thought process surrounding queer people. 
                This is vital for youth, as growing up with less bias, stereotypes, and prejudice will let people grow up with stronger self-esteem and allow individuals to be unique and true to themselves. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Representation helps queer youth feel empowered and seen within the current society that may not fully accept them yet. 
                It supports in many forms from helping youth feel seen and create a sense of visibility and safety, to slowly sifting the macro social stance on queer identities to be more accepting and equal. 
                Losing these types of representation is detrimental to youth’s mental health as society moves backwards on acceptance and kids don’t feel secure in their identity. 
                Moving forward, protecting LGBTQ+ representation is an active choice communities need to make to foster healthier futures for youth and society.
